# Matrix Multiplication using a CREW PRAM

Design a CREW PRAM algorithm that uses O(n^3) processors and O(n^3) memory to compute the matrix C in logarithmic time.

(i) State the pseudo-code that is needed to compute the result for n being a power of two.

(ii) Give a simple solution if n is not a power of two. Is the asymptotic complexity affected?

(iii) Is your solution cost-optimal? If not, make it so.
