# Assignment 7: CUDA "Hello, World!"

For this assignment, please set up and run the "Hello, World!" CUDA program given in the Schmidt textbook (pp. 226-227) on the BU Shared Computing Cluster (SCC).  Every individual must do thisâ€”each member of each team.  Please run the program directly from the command line, and also as a scheduled job, using the job queue as described by Brian.  All you have to submit is

- A screenshot of the output to stdout from when you run the application directly from the command line
- The output file (just the program output, not the diagnostic file) from when you run the application as a job on the queue.

This assignment is designated for individual rather than team submission, but please feel free to work together to help each other to get it done.
